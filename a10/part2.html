    <p> This heatmap, while understandable, is lacking a proper legend and the colors are hard to tell apart.</p>
    <p> The legend doesn't provide any actual numbers and only communicates that lower rates are darker and vice versa.</p>
    <p> It also lacks tooltips so the user can't see proper values, and the overall styling is uneven.</p>
    <div id="new-heatmap"></div>
    <p> The new heatmap made in D3 is properly scaled, has a clearly defined color scale that is more distinct, and the data is properly sourced and titled.</p>
    <p> The legend is correctly and clearly divided, so the viewer can tell what numbers are in what range.</p>
    <p> There are also tooltips on each of the squares to display the values and states for each.</p>
