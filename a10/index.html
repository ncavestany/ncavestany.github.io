    <p> The axes are completely inconsistent in style and scale - on the x-axis, the years are randomly ordered, sized, and overlap. The y-axis also starts and ends at arbitrary values and is not labelled so it's not clear what it's counting (it is not prescription deaths as one might expect from the title).</p>
    <p> Furthermore, the color scale is a sequential color scale for the years with 20+ colors, an arbitrary (and random) choice of colors, and the color legend's placement makes it hard to read.</p>
    <p> The title is also unnecessarily provocative, has no source, and has close to no objective basis.</p>
    <div id="white-hat"></div>
    <p> With this one, the color scale is actually a reasonable qualitative color scale with a proper legend and formatting. </p>
    <p> The font sizes and styling are also consistent, and the axes are properly titled.</p>
    <p> The tooltips are also descriptive and actually show proper values.</p>
    <p> Finally, the title is objective and sources the data.</p>
